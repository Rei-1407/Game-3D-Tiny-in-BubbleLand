A 3D platformer game about the journey of Tiny, a little boy who gets lost in Bubbleland and must find his way back to the real world.  
In this strange land, bubbles serve as Tiny’s mode of transportation. However, to use this unique “vehicle,” Tiny must rely on a special item—a Teleportation Gun.  

## Gameplay Mechanics  

Players take on the role of Tiny and can:  

Move around using WASD keys.  
Sprint temporarily by holding SHIFT.  
Jump using SPACE.  
Press E to equip the Teleportation Gun and Left Click to shoot.  
Press Q to break bubbles (only when inside one).
